# FindRec(Previuosly named FLUID-MMRec)

Please use the public RecBole Framework to run our code.

We also tried to upload the RecBole Framework but encountered a git error: 

On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        RecBole/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

All other files have been successfully updated, and we are currently working to resolve the remaining issues.
